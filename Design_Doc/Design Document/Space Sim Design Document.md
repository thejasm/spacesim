## Abstract

This is a Space Simulation game in which instead of piloting a spaceship, you captain it. Instead of being a lone voyager, you have a crew, and instead of piloting a ship directly, you give orders to your crew who will carry out the tasks.

The Game is split into a character RPG where you play as the captain of your ship. This is done in a 2D topdown Sprite-based gamespace, where your character can walk around ships, space stations, planets, etc. There is also twinstick combat where you move your character and aim a gun and shoot. There are also RPG-like progression, weapons, armor, items, etc. As well as being able to interact with NPCs.

The spaceship view is done in 3D, with 3D models for spaceships, planets, stars, space stations, etc. The player will be able to look around and observe their ship travelling, engaging in combat, or doing other things. From this view the player can order the ship to travel to certain areas, attack enemies, etc. The player also accesses the starchart from here, and use it to spin up the translight engine and travel to other locations.

The third view is a tactical view, where the player is able to give out various orders to various crew members. The view have different tabs, Defense, Power, Maintenance, Crew, etc. And each tab will show different maps of the ship. Defense will show damage areas and breaches on the ship, Power shows where power is routed around the ship, etc. Alongside the map are various orders the player can give to the crew. For example the captain can order the engineers to bypass core safeties in order to make a risky play, or if the ship is about to be hit by a missile, order crew to move away from the targeted sections.
